Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%): TODO

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week: TODO

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face): TODO

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. A 2D Programming Languages themed game using Scala.

2. An extension to the Java language which enables interfaces to specify a required constructor utilizing static validation and annotations.

3. The extension and analysis of cross-cutting concerns in an open-source software system using AspectJ.
